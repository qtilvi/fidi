do the whole libk.a [thing](https://wiki.osdev.org/Meaty_Skeleton#libc_and_libk_Design)  
redirect all `.o` and `.d` files to `fido/build/`, into their respective directory/file
make the required files by [-nostdlib](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Link-Options.html#index-nostdlib)  
add .gitignores where needed  
change readme.md to better (so that's better (I'm tired))
